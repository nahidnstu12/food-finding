### Phase 2

I have researched the backend options for this project, and considering the short time frame, I have decided to use Express.js as the backend framework along with MySQL as the database. 

With this approach, we can start by developing the backend using Express.js and MySQL. Once the backend is up and running, we can seamlessly integrate it with the existing frontend part of the project.
